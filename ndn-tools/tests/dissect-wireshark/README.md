Testing Instructions
====================

This folder contains several crafted tcpdump traces that can be used to manually check
correctness of NDN Packet Dissector for Wireshark in several scenarios.

To use the dissector, follow the instructions in
[dissector's README.md](../../tools/dissect-wireshark/README.md).

`-r <trace-file>` command-line flag can be used to directly open a specific trace file in
WireShark.  For example:

    wireshark -X lua_script:../../tools/dissect-wireshark/ndn.lua -r ipv4-udp-fragmented.pcap

## Test Cases / Trace File Description
